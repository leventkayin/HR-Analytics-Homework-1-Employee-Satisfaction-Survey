But the most unfortunate things is they do not teach you how to do your job.  .  The RAS staffing (number of staff) is not adequate.  The RS C&I took two pre-award positions and gave them to clinical trials.

The OSP guideline is and has been that proposals should be final five working days before the deadline.  Before the RAS we tried to enforce that.  Since th inception of the RAS we are not allowed to push.  As a result, for most of the proposals I do the faculty member drops their final files on the day the proposal is due.

It's exhausting.",1,1,1,1,1,"I have worked a lot of places and this is the WORST place I have ever worked.

I understand the impulse to keep to yourself in this environment but when we are so cut off from the departments the only people around us are RAS peple.

Not sure except that taking these surveys and anything else that just becomes another KPI that someonecan check off does not help.  Managing people is not about reading the latest gimmick and making a checklist.  We need better management, starting with David Wynes and Kathleen Bienkowski.  The fact that you keep incompetent people over us, making more moey than us, doing less to actually get the work done, but more branding so people will think they are doing work, that is the beginning of the bad environment.  You cannot fix them from the bottom up.  Only from the top down.  If you don't do anything els, stop the branding.  Branding is to help people choose one thing over another.  Coke vs Pepsi.  Do the faculty have a choice of what RAS they use, or whether or not they use a RAS?  Of course not, so branding is immaterial unless you are just trying to mke the faculty think everything is OK in the RAS when it is not.  This is the beginning of us being punished for us having opinions of what needs to change in the RAS.

You will only keep perpetuating the status as it is.  By going directly to the workers in the cubicles you will learn a lot and you will also give them the feelin they are respected.  If you as faculty or a RA cannot manage open communication by allowing us to ask questions in open meetings and holding supervisors and directors and RA administrators accountable there is nothing you will ever be able to do to make s believe you respect us or value us.  What we need as people who work in the cubicles often comes out of these types of meetings.  Instead you allow a few people to bottleneck everything.  Your workers are unhappy.  You are not going to get to the root o the issue with a survey.  I've never taken so many surveys in my life as when I came to Emory, and nothing changes.  Work with us face to face.  Doing surveys is an easy way out for the administration.  It allows you to say you tried.  But you didn't realy.  You just went through a checklist.  If you want change.  Talk to us face to face.",1,1,1,1,1,"There are so many things wrong with how RAS admin handles employees and how the faculty let us be handled this way.  We who work in cubicles do not have the power to hold supervisors and directors and OSP, FGC, central RAS to good HR practices or good admn practices.  The fact that faculty allow these people to write anything they want in our annual review or treat us any way they want on a daily basis does not make us feel respected or valued.  It does not make us feel good about the faculty who allow ths.  One reason people preferred working in the departments was that when a chair hired you to do a job and you did it you were treated with respect and you were given an appropriate raise.  Now you hire all these people in between you and your pre-award/pst-award person and we are not treated with respect and we do not get appropriate raises.  But you want to implement ""faculty engagement.""  This is backwards.  We had faculty engagement in the departments.  The RAS units don't need to go away.  You need acompletely different model for how they work. Mostly, get rid of so much middle management.  Have each person permanently assigned to different faculty/departments with contingencies/floaters when the workloads change. Have OSP and FGC and the departmentsput all their rules down on paper and make them responsible for communicating them to us in monthly meetings and on a research intranet (which I know will never happen at Emory's gotcha culture).  Have us answer to the faculty and departments we serve andnot middle management.  Middle management should be responsible for communicating information we need to do our jobs but the departments we serve should be managing our performance.  We are currently managed according to how good we make the RAS and the Vs and directors look to the faculty Ð just branding.
